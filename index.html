	<div class="col-2 text-end"><h3>A little history</h3></div>
	<div class="col-9">
	 <p>Born to a software engineer and paralegal, he never really had a chance when the internet came in to his young life in 1995. Blogging, forums, chatrooms, MUDs, he was an average mid-90's menace. Many hours and one pair of glasses later, he graduated from the Unviersity of California with a degree in English literature and proceeded to <i>work</i>.</p> 
	
	<p>He began in publishing at Red Hen Press where he learned the ins-and-outs of being a non-profit print house, and put pioneered their ebook publishing arm (while learning how to make EPUBS and MOBI, as well as managing an e-store--more on that later.) He got his first software work with Nexon as a localization editor. He also worked briefly at the B2B publication Irrigation and Green Industry Magazine as a writer producing articles and email newsletters.</p> 
	
	<p>After being hired at Internet Brands, he began the work of launching their automotive content arm with John Coyle. For more than 4 years, he worked as content manager, email newsletter editor, writer, freelance supervisor, social media manager. The team grew as we succeeded, and those positions were filled by other writers, email marketers, and editors. I left Internet Brands to work a contract for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as an editor for the Disney Cruise Line Port Excursion pages. Other contracts for creative agencies like Petrol Advertising and Stage 3 Agency followed, including some with my former employer Internet Brands. </p> 
	
	<p>He joined Seville Classics and was immediately tasked with optimising their ecommerce offerings for search. Traditionally, Seville Classics had a strong presence in Sam's Club and Walmart and other box-store retailers. The had some success on Amazon and through their website, but "it could be better." So he went about improving the copy and quality of their Amazon listings, optimizing them for SEO with better titles, feature bullets, product desciptions, and SKU groupings. He became skilled in updating and managing SKUS through Amazon Vendor Central, Wayfair's Partner Portal, and the other big CMS used by Target, Home Depot, and other retailers. That's to say little of many complex A+ marketing pages, or the email marketing copy that he wrote, or social media posts created for outright marketing efforts. Also, he responsible for print related to productsâ€”meaning the writing and proofing of all manuals and assembly instructions and creating shipping labels for each SKU.</p>

	<p>Still, he was a geek, and pursued employment at NortonLifeLock (now Gen Inc.) and was hired as a Sr. UI/UX 
	writer. The appeal of working with a titan of tech security was too strong to pass up, and he excelled. In his 
	time there, he completely revised 400+ alerts in the Norton 360 desktop app--some alerts so, old, so egregious getting to address them personally felt more a pleasure than a chore. He completely revised the sign in flow for users accessing the Norton web portal (including the emails users receive when trying to recover their account.) It came easily, as he was trained for this kind of writing explicity (by his university), implicitly (by his upbringing), and intuitively (by his own hobbies and work).</p>
	
	<p>Today, he's available to work with you.</p>

		<P class="col-9">Marcus? He's a techy copy professional that's been doing it all for the last 10 years. He's pretty good at making techincal processes and jargon easy for normal people. If you're looking for a savvy and easy-to-work with editor, he's your guy.</p>
